There where 2 main problems that I had when making this website.

They where:

* How to add fonts
* How to style and organize my css

I used Google Fonts to add fonts to my website. Google Fonts provides free fonts that you can link or import to your html.

I mostly used flexbox to layout my site, and BEM to organize my css. BEM is a naming convention, in css, in which you create blocks to grab certain parts of similar html to style them. A block is a html element that is meaningful on its own. Inside these blocks you can grab elements and style them. A element is a part of a block that has no meaning on its own and is tied to its block. You can also modify blocks or elements. A modifier is a flag that can be on a block or element. Use them to change appearance or behavior.
