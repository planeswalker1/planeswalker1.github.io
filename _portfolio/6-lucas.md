There where 2 main problems that I had when making this website.

They where:

* How to make the website responsive
* Should I use a hamburger nav

I learned about media queries and had to decide if I wanted to make websites mobile first. For now I decided to make websites desktop first and then add media queries to make my sites responsive.

I usually use hamburger navs if I have more than 4 links. If there is more than 4 links the menu items will not be able to fit across the nav.
